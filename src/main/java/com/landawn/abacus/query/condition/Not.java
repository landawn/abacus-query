package com.landawn.abacus.query.condition;

/**
 * Represents a NOT logical operator in SQL conditions.
 * This class negates the result of any given condition, reversing its boolean logic.
 * It's a fundamental logical operator used to invert query conditions.
 * 
 * <p>The NOT operator is particularly useful for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Negating complex conditions without rewriting them</li>
 *   <li>Creating more readable queries by expressing what you don't want</li>
 *   <li>Inverting existing conditions dynamically</li>
 *   <li>Building flexible query builders that can toggle conditions</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Truth table:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>NOT TRUE = FALSE</li>
 *   <li>NOT FALSE = TRUE</li>
 *   <li>NOT NULL = NULL (in SQL three-valued logic)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // NOT with LIKE - find names that don't contain "test"
 * Like likeCondition = new Like("name", "%test%");
 * Not notLike = new Not(likeCondition);
 * // Results in: NOT (name LIKE '%test%')
 * 
 * // NOT with IN - exclude specific departments
 * In deptCondition = new In("department_id", Arrays.asList(10, 20, 30));
 * Not notInDepts = new Not(deptCondition);
 * // Results in: NOT (department_id IN (10, 20, 30))
 * 
 * // NOT with complex condition - find orders that are NOT (high priority AND urgent)
 * And complexCondition = new And(
 *     new Equal("priority", "HIGH"),
 *     new Equal("status", "URGENT")
 * );
 * Not notUrgentHigh = new Not(complexCondition);
 * // Results in: NOT (priority = 'HIGH' AND status = 'URGENT')
 * 
 * // NOT with EXISTS subquery
 * SubQuery hasOrders = new SubQuery("SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id");
 * Exists existsCondition = new Exists(hasOrders);
 * Not noOrders = new Not(existsCondition);
 * // Results in: NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id)
 * }</pre>
 *

 * @see Or
 * @see NotIn
 * @see NotBetween
