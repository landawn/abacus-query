/**
 * Represents a LIKE condition in SQL queries for pattern matching.
 * This class is used to create conditions that perform pattern matching on string values
 * using SQL LIKE syntax with wildcards. The LIKE operator provides flexible string matching
 * capabilities that go beyond simple equality checks, making it essential for search
 * functionality and text filtering.
 * 
 * <p>The LIKE operator supports two standard SQL wildcards:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>% (percent sign): Matches any sequence of zero or more characters</li>
 *   <li>_ (underscore): Matches any single character</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Common use cases include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Searching for partial matches in text fields</li>
 *   <li>Finding records that start with, end with, or contain specific patterns</li>
 *   <li>Implementing flexible search functionality</li>
 *   <li>Pattern validation (e.g., email format, phone number patterns)</li>
 *   <li>Autocomplete and type-ahead features</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Performance considerations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Patterns starting with % prevent index usage (full table scan)</li>
 *   <li>Patterns starting with literal characters can use indexes efficiently</li>
 *   <li>Consider full-text search for complex text searching needs</li>
 *   <li>Case sensitivity depends on database collation settings</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Find all names starting with "John"
 * Like startsWithJohn = new Like("name", "John%");
 * // SQL: name LIKE 'John%'
 * // Matches: "John", "Johnson", "Johnny", etc.
 * 
 * // Find all emails ending with "@example.com"
 * Like exampleEmails = new Like("email", "%@example.com");
 * // Generates: email LIKE '%@example.com'
 * // Matches: "user@example.com", "admin@example.com", etc.
 * 
 * // Find all products containing "phone" anywhere in the name
 * Like phoneProducts = new Like("product_name", "%phone%");
 * // Generates: product_name LIKE '%phone%'
 * // Matches: "iPhone", "Smartphone", "Headphones", etc.
 * 
 * // Find all 5-letter words starting with 'A' and ending with 'E'
 * Like pattern = new Like("word", "A___E");
 * // Generates: word LIKE 'A___E'
 * // Matches: "APPLE", "ANKLE", "ANGLE", etc.
 * 
 * // Complex pattern matching
 * Like complexPattern = new Like("code", "PRD-20__-___");
 * // Generates: code LIKE 'PRD-20__-___'
 * // Matches: "PRD-2023-001", "PRD-2024-ABC", etc.
 * }</pre>

     * 
     * // Contains pattern - requires full table scan
     * Like contains = new Like("description", "%important%");
     * // Matches: "This is important", "unimportant details", "important", etc.
     * 
     * // Specific character positions using underscore
     * Like pattern = new Like("code", "A_B_C");
     * // Matches: "A1B2C", "AXBYC", "A-B-C", etc.
     * 
     * // Mixed wildcards for complex patterns
     * Like mixed = new Like("serial", "SN-%_____");
     * // Matches: "SN-12345", "SN-ABCDE", etc.
     * 
     * // Email domain pattern
     * Like emailDomain = new Like("email", "%@%.com");
     * // Matches any .com email address
     * 
     * // Phone number pattern (specific format)
     * Like phonePattern = new Like("phone", "(___) ___-____");
     * // Matches: "(555) 123-4567" format
     * 
     * // Escape special characters if needed (syntax varies by database)
     * Like escaped = new Like("path", "%\\_%"); // To match literal underscore
     * // Check your database documentation for escape syntax
     * }</pre>

     * @param propValue the pattern to match, including wildcards. Must not be null.
     *                  Use % for any characters, _ for single character.
