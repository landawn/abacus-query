/**
 * A utility class that provides a comprehensive dictionary of commonly used characters and strings,
 * including special characters, operators, SQL keywords, and mathematical functions.
 * This class serves as a centralized repository for string constants to avoid hardcoding
 * and improve code maintainability.
 *
 * <p>All fields in this class are public static final constants representing either
 * single characters (prefixed with underscore) or their string equivalents.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Examples:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Building SQL queries
 * String query = SK.SELECT + SK.SPACE + "*" + SK.SPACE + SK.FROM + SK.SPACE + "users";
 * // Result: "SELECT * FROM users"
 *
 * // Building CSV strings
 * String csv = "John" + SK.COMMA_SPACE + "Doe" + SK.COMMA_SPACE + "30";
 * // Result: "John, Doe, 30"
 *
 * // Using SQL operators
 * String condition = "age" + SK.SPACE + SK.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL + SK.SPACE + "18";
 * // Result: "age >= 18"
